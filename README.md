# Blending Sea Surface Temperature and Satellite Altimetry Observations Using Deep Learning Improves Sea Surface Height Mapping

Code used to obtain the results presented in: Martin, S., Manucharyan, G., & Klein, P., 2022, Journal of Advances in Modelling Earth Systems.

## Description

In this study we present a novel deep learning method for more accurately mapping sea surface height (SSH) by combining satellite altimetry and sea surface temperature (SST) observations. This repository provides:
* Code to generate training data from the publicly available satellite altimetry and SST observation datasets following the pre-processing steps described in the manuscript
* Code to define, train, and make predictions with the deep learning model described in the manuscript
* Underlying data for the figures presented in the manuscript
* A Jupyter Notebook for reproducing all the figures in the manuscript
